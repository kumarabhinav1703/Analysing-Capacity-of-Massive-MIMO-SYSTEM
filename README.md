# Analysing-Capacity-of-Massive-MIMO-SYSTEM
1. Analysed the impact of Power Scaling on Capacity by varing the number of antenna at the receiver in a massive MIMO system ,comparing scenario with known CSI to those with receiver- estimated CSI

a) Please refer the plot given in "Project 4: Analysed the impact of Power Scaling on Capacity by varing the number of antenna at the receiver in a massive MIMO system ,comparing scenario with known CSI to those with receiver- estimated CSI." in "MIMO_projects.ipynb"
